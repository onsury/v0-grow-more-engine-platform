                  <p>
                    <strong>1985:</strong> At just 16, Sathish Kumar made a decision that would change everything. His
                    father's milk business was failing, and instead of hitting the books, he hit the streets. School
                    dropout? Yes. Visionary? Absolutely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>The Struggle:</strong> What started as a desperate attempt to save the family business
                    became a masterclass in turning adversity into opportunity. From milk trading to paneer production,
                    every step was a lesson in resilience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>The Breakthrough:</strong> 1994 - Paneer production begins. 1997 - "Milky Mist" brand is
                    born. 2010 - First TV commercial takes the brand to millions of households. 2018 - Fully automated
                    robotic processing with German technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>The Empire:</strong> From 3 metric tons of paneer per day in 2011 to a full dairy empire by
                    2023. 20+ products, own logistics chain, and operations across India and international markets.
